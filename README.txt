Install the validator using 'python setyp.py install' inside this directory.
It installs two entry points:
(1) validator-example : 'Auto-Pilot' that demonstrates the power of the validator
(2) validate : usage: 'validate <CODE_PATH>', validate a module by your choise.

Note that although we have written a simpler that simples a whole package into 1 module, 
this option is in 'beta' and does not work good enough. So our recommendation is to validate 1 module at a time.
If you are still interested in this, you can see main.py in validator.simplers to see how to use it.


To uninstall the package use pip uninstall pythonvalidator.


Enjoy.
