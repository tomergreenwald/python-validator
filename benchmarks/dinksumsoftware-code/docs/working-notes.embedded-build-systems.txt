buildroot       "makefile" based
                config programs (a la kernel) for kernel, root filesystem, busybox

open-embedded   "bitbake"  based
                looks like board specific


angstrom        sits on open-embedded
                  Targets small systems.
                  Has an on-line builder
                  Seemed to target specific boards
                  looks like there own package system (.ipk?)

SHR             sits on open-embedded
                  SHR is a GNU/Linux based operating system for smartphones
                  and similar mobile devices

Yocto Project   sits on open-embedded
                sits on Poky which sits on open-embedded
                calls out ubuntu (not debian)
                python based
                Seems like the cat's meow.
                Generates an SDK that plugs into Eclipse
                they fix what source goes into the build.
                Has an emulator (GEMU)

Poky 
     is a reference system for the Yocto Project, showing how the tools work together.
     It includes BitBake, openembedded-core, and several other components that anyone
     can use to start developing with embedded Linux. Poky as a build system is tested
     by the Yocto Project teams before each release. When you download and use the Yocto
     Project build system, you are actually downloading Poky and using it to create a
     distribution that by default is also named Poky
     (You can, of course, name your distribution anything you like.)
